# FLASK_AUTHENTICATION

SUMMARY

As an intern in INCHTECH Sarl I was given a task to build an authentication page that is Login page and Signup page. To excute this task I was asked to use Flask and Sqlite. In this task, Flask served as the carrier or connector of all the different pages that exist, and SQLite helped as a  self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine that will collect the user informations and store in a database.

TOOLS USED IN THIS TASK

- python -m venv env  __ for a virtual environment
- source env/Scripts/activate __ to activate our virtual environment
- pip install Flask Flask-Login Flask-Bcrypt Flask-WTF FLask-Migrate Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Testing python-decouple ____ to install of the modules needed to successfully excute flask functions

LANGUAGES AND FRAMEWORKS USED

- HTML
- CSS
- Python
